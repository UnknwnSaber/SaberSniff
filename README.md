## Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied / socket error:**  
  Run the script as root (Linux/macOS) or as Administrator (Windows).
- **Python not found:**  
  Ensure Python 3 is installed and added to your PATH.
- **No packets displayed:**  
  Make sure your firewall isnâ€™t blocking raw sockets. Try running on a different network interface.
